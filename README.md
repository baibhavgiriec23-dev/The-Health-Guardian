# Health Guardian — ESP32 Real-Time Health Monitoring System
~A collabrative project by Ayush Deep and Baibhav Giri

Health Guardian is a real-time embedded health monitoring system built using ESP32 and biomedical sensors.  
It measures heart rate, SpO₂, ECG, body temperature, and motion/orientation, and displays live data via a Wi-Fi hosted web dashboard with a JSON API backend.

Features
- Multi-sensor biomedical data acquisition
- Heart Rate & SpO₂ (MAX30102)
- ECG monitoring (AD8232)
- Temperature sensing (DS18B20)
- Motion/orientation tracking (MPU6050)
- Wi-Fi web dashboard for live vitals
- JSON API for external integrations
- Non-blocking firmware for reliable real-time sampling
